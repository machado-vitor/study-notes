# EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

AWS's service for renting virtual servers in the cloud.

Instead of buying physical servers, you:
1. Choose instance type (CPU, memory, storage specs)
2. Launch virtual machine in minutes
3. Pay only for what you use (per hour/second)
4. Scale up/down as needed

Key features:
- **Elastic**: Add/remove instances based on demand
- **Flexible**: Choose OS, instance size, storage
- **Global**: Deploy in any AWS region
- **Integrated**: Works with other AWS services (S3, RDS, VPC)

Think of it as renting a computer in AWS's data center that you access remotely and configure however you need.
