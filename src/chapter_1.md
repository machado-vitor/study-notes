# Introduction

This is a personal repository for organizing my studies in software development and computer science.

The goal is to maintain detailed notes, quick references, and practical projects as I learn new topics.

## How This Book is Organized

This book follows the same structure as the repository:

- **Programming Notes**: Detailed explanations and summaries for programming topics including Java, networking, and more
- **Cheatsheets**: Quick references and syntax summaries
- **Books**: Notes and takeaways from technical books
- **Exercises**: Algorithm problems and coding challenges
- **Projects**: Small projects and experiments to apply concepts
- **Snippets**: Small, reusable code pieces
- **Journal**: Study logs and reflections
- **Resources**: Curated lists of articles, videos, and papers
